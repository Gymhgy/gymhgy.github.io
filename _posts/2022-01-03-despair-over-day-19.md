# Despair

![Sadness.](assets/adventofcode2021-47stars.png)

It has been 8 days since Christmas, counting today. I have still not saved Christmas, due to day 19. Just reading the problem description, I am too demoralized to even begin an attempt.

For those unaware, Day 19 gives you a number of scanners which have info on beacon locations relative to the scanner. You must piece together the scanners since some scanners share beacons. The kicker is that each scanner has it's own orientation. So not only must you match, you must also orient each scanner to a single unified orientation.

I probably could do it if I put my efforts into it, but I just can't bring myself to do so. The only attempt I've made so far was computing a distance matrix for each scanners, and then putting it off after being faced with the task of pairing beacons according to the matrices.

I'll take another stab tomorrow.
